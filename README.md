Raspberry Works is comprised of three applications: Members, Staff and Admin

Member is the member facing application. We consider members to be users with 
active resources such as dedicated, desk, office, day use.  Staff is the application used by staff members to help with the overall management of the community. 

Admin has absolute power to everything.
